## Build Scripts

BaseWeb uses [Node](https://nodejs.org/), [Jake](http://jakejs.com/) and [Jake-Builds](https://github.com/sebnitu/jake-builds) for building both the source and docs. For more information on how to update build scripts using this stack, make sure to checkout [Jake-Builds](https://github.com/sebnitu/jake-builds).

### Node Packages
Run `npm install` to install required node modules for build scripts. This is the following node stack used to build BaseWeb assets and documentation files:

| Node Modules   | Versions   | Description |
|----------------|------------|-------------|
| `jake`         | `8.0.12`   | The JavaScript build tool for Node.js |
| `node-watch`   | `0.3.4`    | Used in handling the watch task |
| `node-sass`    | `2.1.1`    | Used for compiling and minifying src and doc CSS from SCSS files |
| `uglify-js`    | `2.4.19`   | Used to compile and minify our JavaScript files |
| `imagemin`     | `3.1.0`    | Used to optimize our image files |
| `mustache`     | `2.0.0`    | Used to build our HTML files for docs, examples and readme |

*Keep in mind that if you use the imagemin module, [Jpegtran](http://jpegclub.org/jpegtran/) should be installed globally. You can install it with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using: `brew install jpeg`*

### Jake Tasks
